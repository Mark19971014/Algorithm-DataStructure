    "Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.\n",
    "2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.\n",
    "3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.\n",

    "# Sudoku Grid Sub-division\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Sudoku game, the `9x9` board is divided into nine sub-grids, each being a `3x3` matrix. The board can be visualized as 3 rows and 3 columns of these sub-grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `row_start` and `col_start` calculations determine the top-left cell of each sub-grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `row_start = 3 * (i // 3)`: Determines the row where a sub-grid starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Integer division by `3` finds out which row of sub-grids we're in (0, 1, or 2).\n",
    "  - Multiplying by `3` gives the actual starting row index within the `9x9` board (0, 3, or 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `col_start = 3 * (i % 3)`: Determines the column where a sub-grid starts.\n",
    "  - The modulus operator gives the remainder when `i` is divided by `3`, indicating which column of sub-grids we're in (0, 1, or 2).\n",
    "  - Multiplying by `3` gives the starting column index within the `9x9` board (0, 3, or 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "# sudoku Grid Sub traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "- `row_sub =  row_start + (j // 3)`: Determines the row where a sub-grid starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Integer division by `3` finds out which row of sub-grids we're in (0, 1, or 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `col_sub = col_start + (j  % 3)`: Determines the column where a sub-grid starts.\n",

    "## Sudoku Validation Algorithm Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the Sudoku validation algorithm is **O(1)**. This is because the algorithm processes each of the 81 cells exactly once and the board size is fixed (9x9). All operations within the single pass are constant time operations, including set insertion and membership tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is also **O(1)** because the extra space used (for the sets storing row, column, and subgrid values) does not increase with the size of the Sudoku board. At most, each set can hold 9 elements (digits 1-9) and they are reused across the checks. Therefore, the amount of memory used remains constant, regardless of the board configuration.\n"
